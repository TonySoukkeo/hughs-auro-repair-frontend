          Here at Hughâ€™s Diesel & Auto Repair, we are nothing but honest; we
          refuse to take advantage of any of our customers. Our shop works on
          everything that walks in the door: diesel and gas pickups, cars,
          semis, campers, generators, trailers, and much more!

          and his mechanics keep up on the most recent education and technology
          in the field; we will always grow with the changes. You will leave our
          shop feeling safe and happy.
